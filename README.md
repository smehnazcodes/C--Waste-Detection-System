This is the code of my very first robot. The robot was designed with the system of Smart Waste Management. It was capable to take and dump debris and rotate 180 degrees via servo motors when the sonar sensor could identify a person. Further, through the soil moisture sensor, the system also detected organic & inorganic waste.
